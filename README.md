To run this project locally, you need:
1. Fetch it by https (https://github.com/yaroslav-lysenko-axon/DeveloperCodingTest.git) or ssh (git@github.com:yaroslav-lysenko-axon/DeveloperCodingTest.git) and open in your IDE via "Get from Version Control" menu;
2. Press button "Run" in IDE;
3. Go by this link "http://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html" to Browser (to use Swagger);
4. HTTP method GET/HackerNews -> Try it out -> Execute.

I would like to add here:
- exceptions handling. So, I just added common exception;
- links to the appSettings instead const;
- create httpClient methods as a Generic;
